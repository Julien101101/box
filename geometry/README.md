# Grammar Guide

This README serves as a resource for understanding and improving grammar in your writing. 

## Parts of Speech

* **Nouns:** Words that name people, places, things, or ideas (e.g., book, teacher, happiness).
* **Verbs:** Words that describe actions, states of being, or occurrences (e.g., run, is, happens).
* **Adjectives:** Words that describe nouns or pronouns (e.g., big, interesting, several).
* **Adverbs:** Words that describe verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire sentences (e.g., quickly, very, often).
* **Pronouns:** Words that take the place of nouns (e.g., he, she, it, they, them).
* **Prepositions:** Words that show the relationship between a noun or pronoun and other words in a sentence (e.g., in, on, at, to, from).
* **Conjunctions:** Words that join words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or, for, because).
* **Interjections:** Words that express emotion or surprise (e.g., ouch, wow, hello).

## Sentence Structure

A basic sentence typically follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) structure:

* **Subject:** The noun or pronoun that performs the action or is being described.
* **Verb:** The action or state of being.
* **Object:** The recipient of the action (direct object) or modifies the verb (indirect object).

Here's an example:

> **The cat (subject) chased (verb) the mouse (direct object) across the room (prepositional phrase).**

## Common Grammar Mistakes

* **Subject-verb agreement:** Ensure the subject and verb agree in number (singular or plural).
* **Comma splices:** Join run-on sentences with a proper conjunction or period.
* **Dangling modifiers:** Ensure modifiers clearly relate to the intended words.
* **Misplaced modifiers:** Place adverbs carefully to avoid confusion.
* **Pronoun reference:** Ensure pronouns refer clearly to specific nouns.
